                                the Soviet Union. Developed by the Mikoyan
                                design bureau as an air superiority fighter
                                during the 1970s, the MiG-29, along with the
                                larger Sukhoi Su-27, was developed to counter
                                new U.S. fighters such as the McDonnell Douglas
                                F-15 Eagle and the General Dynamics F-16
                                Fighting Falcon. The MiG-29 entered service with
                                the Soviet Air Forces in 1982.

                                light fighter designed by the Aeronautical
                                Development Agency (ADA) in collaboration with

                                Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the
                                Indian Air Force and Indian Navy. It came from
                                the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) programme, which
                                began in the 1980s to replace India's ageing
                                MiG-21 fighters but later became part of a
                                general fleet modernisation programme. In 2003,
                                the LCA was officially named "Tejas". It is the
                                smallest and lightest in its class of
                                contemporary supersonic combat aircraft.

                                fighter manufactured by Dassault Aviation. It
                                was designed in the late 1970s as a lightweight
                                fighter to replace the Mirage III for the French
                                Air Force (Armée de l'air). The Mirage 2000
                                evolved into a multirole aircraft with several
                                variants developed, with sales to a number of
                                nations. It was later developed into the Mirage
                                2000N and 2000D strike variants, the improved
                                Mirage 2000-5, and several export variants. Over
                                600 aircraft were built and it has been in
                                service with 9 nations.

                                the civil version. The first flight was in 1999.

                                narrow-body airliner that was developed and

                                first jetliner. Developed from the Boeing
                                367-80, a prototype first flown in 1954, the
                                initial 707-120 first flew on December 20, 1957.
                                Pan American World Airways began regular 707
                                service on October 26, 1958. The airplane was
                                built until 1979. A quadjet, the 707 has a swept
                                wing with podded engines. Its larger fuselage
                                cross-section allowed six-abreast economy

                                strategic airlifter designed by the Soviet
                                Union's Ilyushin design bureau. It was first
                                planned as a commercial freighter in 1967, as a
                                replacement for the Antonov An-12. It was
                                designed to deliver heavy machinery to remote,
                                poorly served areas. Military versions of the
                                Il-76 have been widely used in Europe, Asia and
                                Africa, including use as an aerial refueling
                                tanker or command center.

                                developed for the United States Air Force (USAF)
                                from the 1980s to the early 1990s by McDonnell
                                Douglas. The C-17 carries forward the name of
                                two previous piston-engined military cargo
                                aircraft, the Douglas C-74 Globemaster and the
                                Douglas C-124 Globemaster II. The C-17 commonly
                                performs tactical and strategic airlift
                                missions, transporting troops and cargo
                                throughout the world; additional roles include
                                medical evacuation and airdrop duties. It was
                                designed to replace the Lockheed C-141
                                Starlifter, and also fulfill some of the duties
                                of the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy.

                                The <b>Boeing AH-64 Apache</b> (/əˈpætʃi/) is an
                                American twin-turboshaft attack helicopter with
                                a tailwheel-type landing gear arrangement and a
                                tandem cockpit for a crew of two. It features a
                                nose-mounted sensor suite for target acquisition
                                and night vision systems. It is armed with a 30
                                mm (1.18 in) M230 chain gun carried between the
                                main landing gear, under the aircraft's forward
                                fuselage, and four hardpoints mounted on
                                stub-wing pylons for carrying armament and
                                stores, typically a mixture of AGM-114 Hellfire
                                missiles and Hydra 70 rocket pods. The AH-64 has
                                significant systems redundancy to improve combat
                                survivability.

                                operations of up to 52 hours' duration at up to
                                10.5 km (35,000 ft). It has demonstrated 52
                                hours of continuous flight, but the effective
                                operational maximal flight duration is less,
                                according to payload and flight profile. An

                                the IAI Eitan.
