                                rifle of German origin. It was developed by
                                Mauser in the mid-1970’s from a conventional
                                hunting rifle design. The SP66 was developed for
                                both military and law enforcement use. The SP66
                                was replaced in production with the Mauser 86SR.

                                World War I by John Browning. Its design is
                                similar to Browning's earlier M1919 Browning
                                machine gun, which was chambered for the .30-06
                                cartridge. The M2 uses the much larger and much
                                more powerful .50 BMG (12.7 mm) cartridge, which
                                was developed alongside and takes its name from
                                the gun itself (BMG standing for Browning
                                machine gun). It has been referred to as "Ma

                                weapon. It is a single barrel breach loading
                                weapon superior to 12 Bore DBBL. It is provided
                                with a tubular magazine, which holds 4 nos. of
                                12 Bore Cartridges and is placed parallel to and
                                below the barrel. Extraction, loading and
                                cocking of the cartridges take place in a single
                                'pump action' by operating handle, sliding along
                                the magazine. Due to rapid reloading by pump
                                action and spread of shots, it is an ideal
                                weapon for counter ambush tactics.

                                incorporates many features found on the T-80U.
                                Originally called the T-72BU, but later renamed
                                to T-90, it is an advanced tank in service with
                                Russian Ground Forces and the Naval Infantry.
                                The T-90 uses a 125 mm 2A46 smoothbore main gun,
                                the 1A45T fire-control system, an upgraded
                                engine, and gunner's thermal sight. Standard
                                protective measures include a blend of steel and
                                composite armour, smoke grenade dischargers,
                                Kontakt-5 explosive-reactive armour and the
                                Shtora infrared ATGM jamming system. It was
                                designed and built by Uralvagonzavod, in Nizhny
                                Tagil, Russia.

                                the Indian Army. The system has a maximum range
                                of 40 km for Mark-I and 60 km for Mark-I
                                enhanced version, and can fire a salvo of 12 HE
                                rockets in 44 seconds. The system is mounted on
                                a Tatra truck for mobility. Pinaka saw service
                                during the Kargil War, where it was successful
                                in neutralising enemy positions on the mountain
                                tops. It has since been inducted into the Indian

                                <b>Central acquisition radar (CAR)</b> is a
                                medium-range high-resolution 3D surveillance
                                radar. Central acquisition radar was designed by
                                LRDE, a DRDO laboratory, and is produced by a
                                joint venture between BEL, Larsen & Toubro,
                                Astra Microwave and Entec. The radar employs a
                                planar array antenna and provides simultaneous
                                multi-beam coverage. It can handle 150 targets
                                in track while scan mode and has a range of 170
                                km and up to 18 km altitude.
